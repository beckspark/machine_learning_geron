# Machine Learning by Geron

This repo is used to store Jupyter notebooks in my personal study of the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632). I organize the different sections of the book with markdown notes and headings, making comments where I'm writing code that deviates or does something differently from the book's instructions.

Let me know if you find anything here worth commenting on, or any feedback!

## Poetry Environment
I use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org) to manage my Python environments.
* If you have poetry installed, you can simply do ```poetry update``` in the git directory in order to add my environment to your machine.
